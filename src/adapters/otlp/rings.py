"""Bounded counted log ring for the OTLP ingest adapter (spec §4.2.1, phase 5).

Design constraints (from Architecture paragraph + round-1 review):

Ring backing store
  ``collections.deque`` WITHOUT ``maxlen`` plus an explicit eviction loop.
  ``deque(maxlen=N)`` silently evicts with NO counter increment — the M4
  mutation (swap to maxlen) proves the tests catch this.  The explicit
  ``while len >= capacity: popleft(); dropped += 1`` loop is the ONLY
  design that gives an honest ``dropped_oldest`` count.

Clock domain
  ``covered_window`` uses ``recv_ts`` (the receiver-side timestamp passed to
  ``append``) — never any timestamp embedded inside the record (sender clock).
  This is the M5 constraint: sender clocks can be skewed; receiver clock is
  the authoritative bound.

Lock discipline (M9b reviewer audit)
  The ``threading.Lock`` guards ONLY these operations:
    - ``append``: ``popleft`` + ``_buf.append`` + counter increments
    - ``snapshot``: ``list(self._buf)``
    - ``note_truncated``: ``self._truncated_records += n``
    - ``covered_window``/``stats``: read of ``_dropped_oldest``,
      ``_truncated_records``, ``len(self._buf)``, ``self._buf[0][0]``
  No ISO formatting, no datetime construction, no ``time.time()`` call,
  and no ``await`` occurs inside any critical section.

Empty ring behaviour
  An empty ring with zero drops returns ``(iso(start_ts), iso(now))``
  — NOT ``None``.  This is an honest answer: "the receiver started at
  start_ts and has seen nothing yet."

Covered-window honesty
  The lower bound (start) is ceil'd to the next whole second before
  rendering (``iso_z(math.ceil(lower_ts))``).  Flooring the start would
  claim up-to-1 s MORE coverage than actually observed — the dishonest
  direction.  Ceiling is conservative: it never overstates coverage.
  The upper bound (``now``) stays as-is (floor is fine for an open end).

  Task-5 MUST use ``iso_z`` (this module's public renderer) for
  requested_window rendering — ONE-renderer mandate.
