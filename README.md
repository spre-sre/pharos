## Quick Start

Get started with LUMINO in under 2 minutes:

### For Claude Code CLI Users (Easiest)

Simply ask Claude Code to provision the Pharos MCP server for you by pasting this prompt:

```text
Provision the Pharos MCP server as a project-local MCP integration:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://TBD-NEW-REMOTE
   cd pharos

2. Install Python dependencies using uv:
   uv sync

3. Create .mcp.json in the current project root (NOT inside pharos) with this configuration.
   IMPORTANT: Replace <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PHAROS> with the actual absolute path to the cloned pharos directory:

   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "pharos": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PHAROS>/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PHAROS>/main.py"],
         "env": {
           "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
         }
       }
     }
   }

4. After creating .mcp.json, inform the user to:
   - Exit Claude Code completely
   - Connect to their Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster (kubectl/oc login)
   - Restart Claude Code in this project directory
   - They will see a prompt to approve the Pharos MCP server
   - Once approved, Pharos tools will be available (check with /mcp command)
```

### For Other MCP Clients

Choose your preferred installation method:

- **MCPM**: pending re-publish under the new remote (see [MCP Client Integration](#mcp-client-integration))
- **Manual Setup**: See detailed [MCP Client Integration](#mcp-client-integration) instructions

### Verify Installation

Once installed, test with a simple query:

```text
"List all namespaces in my Kubernetes cluster"
```

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Python 3.10 or higher** - Core runtime
- **MCP Client** - One of:
  - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
  - [Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-cli)
  - [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)

### For Kubernetes Features

- **Kubernetes/OpenShift Access** - Valid kubeconfig with read permissions
- **RBAC Permissions** - Ability to list pods, namespaces, and other resources

### Optional (Recommended)

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** - Faster dependency management than pip
- **[MCPM](https://TBD-NEW-REMOTE)** - Easiest installation experience
- **Prometheus** - For advanced metrics and forecasting features

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://TBD-NEW-REMOTE
cd pharos

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run python main.py
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://TBD-NEW-REMOTE
cd pharos

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the server
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Local Mode (stdio transport)

By default, the server runs in local mode using stdio transport, suitable for direct integration with MCP clients:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Kubernetes Mode (HTTP streaming transport)

When running inside Kubernetes, set the namespace environment variable to enable HTTP streaming:

```bash
export KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=my-namespace
python main.py
```

The server automatically detects the environment and switches transport modes.

## Configuration

### Kubernetes Authentication

The server automatically detects Kubernetes configuration:

1. **In-cluster config** - When running inside a Kubernetes pod
2. **Local kubeconfig** - When running locally (uses `~/.kube/config`)

### Environment Variables

See also the transport env vars (`LUMINO_TRANSPORT`, `LUMINO_BIND_HOST`, `LUMINO_HTTP_TOKEN`, …) in the [MCP Client Integration](#mcp-client-integration) section and `config.example.yaml` for the full transport reference.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `LUMINO_PROFILE` | `konflux` | Built-in profile: `konflux` (49 tools), `kubernetes` (37), `standalone` (37). See [Profiles](#profiles). |
| `LUMINO_CONFIG` | *(none)* | Path to a `config.yaml` file; overrides `LUMINO_PROFILE` when set. |
| `KUBECONFIG` | `~/.kube/config` | Path to kubeconfig; multiple clusters or non-default location. |
| `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` | *(none)* | Namespace for in-cluster mode; also triggers streamable-http transport. |
| `K8S_NAMESPACE` | *(none)* | Alternative to `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`. |
| `KUBEARCHIVE_HOST` | Auto-detected | Explicit KubeArchive API endpoint URL. |
| `KUBEARCHIVE_ENABLED` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable KubeArchive queries entirely. |
| `KUBEARCHIVE_TOKEN` | Auto-detected | Bearer token for KubeArchive auth; operator-supplied credential for vanilla-k8s local dev (priority 1.5 — checked after a constructor-supplied token, before the in-cluster SA token). |
| `PROMETHEUS_URL` | Auto-detected | Prometheus server URL; takes lower priority than `THANOS_URL`. |
| `THANOS_URL` | Auto-detected | Thanos Query endpoint URL; takes priority over `PROMETHEUS_URL`. |
| `PROMETHEUS_TOKEN` | Auto-detected | Bearer token for Prometheus/Thanos auth (checked first). |
| `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` | Auto-detected | OpenShift bearer token for Prometheus/Thanos (checked second). |
| `OC_TOKEN` | Auto-detected | Last-resort token fallback for Prometheus/Thanos auth. |
| `LUMINO_STRICT_MODEL_LOADING` | `true` | ML model integrity enforcement. Set to `false` to allow loading unsigned legacy models (ml_persistence). |
| `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM` | `false` (set by server) | HuggingFace tokenizers thread safety; the server sets this to `false` automatically when the optional `logan` pack loads. |
| `LUMINO_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | *(any value)* | **No-op.** This variable is not read by `src/` or `main.py`. It appears in test scrub lists for historical reasons only. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`. |
| `MCP_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | MCP framework log level; separate from application logging. |
| `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` | *(none)* | Disable Python output buffering; recommended for MCP clients. |

## Profiles

Pharos ships three built-in profiles selectable via `LUMINO_PROFILE` (or the `profile:` key in `config.yaml`). These counts are machine-verified by `tests/test_profile_docs.py` — changing them triggers a test failure (M5 drift defence).

| Profile | Tools | Sources declared | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `konflux` (default) | **49** | kubernetes, prometheus, kubearchive (disabled) | Registers all tools including the 12 Tekton/OpenShift/Konflux extension tools. |
| `kubernetes` | **37** | kubernetes, prometheus | Same 37-tool set as `standalone`; the difference is which sources are declared. |
| `standalone` | **37** | **none** | Registers the same 37 k8s-shaped tools as `kubernetes`, but declares zero sources. All tool calls will fail at dispatch until the operator adds `file`, `loki`, `elasticsearch`, or `otlp` source entries in `config.yaml`. The "analysis harness mode" described in the spec is the **intent**, not the default behaviour. |

**The 12 extension tools** present under `konflux` but absent under `kubernetes`/`standalone`:

```
analyze_failed_pipeline         ci_cd_performance_baselining_tool
find_pipeline                   get_etcd_logs
get_machine_config_pool_status  get_openshift_cluster_operator_status
get_pipelinerun_logs            get_tekton_pipeline_runs_status
list_pipelineruns               list_recent_pipeline_runs
list_taskruns                   pipeline_tracer
```

**Canonical aliases** (6 tool pairs added in phase 2c) are registered unconditionally regardless of profile. Both the canonical and the original name dispatch to the same function body and produce identical output; no consumer change is required. See the canonical-name table in [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md#canonical-name-aliases-44).

For migration notes from the upstream `b6c24f27` snapshot or the GitLab 21-tool downstream, see [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md).

## ML Model Persistence

The `predictive_log_analyzer` tool persists trained ML models and training data locally in `~/.lumino/`. This enables model reuse across server restarts and incremental learning from historical failure patterns.

### Directory Structure

```text
~/.lumino/
├── models/                     # Trained ML models
│   ├── {model_id}.joblib       # Serialized model (e.g. IsolationForest via joblib)
│   ├── {model_id}.meta.json    # Model metadata (created, last used, performance metrics)
│   └── model_index.json        # Index tracking all models and the current active model
└── training_data/              # Training data store
    └── training_data.db        # SQLite database
```

Model IDs follow the pattern `predictive_log_v1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.

### Training Data Database

The SQLite database (`training_data.db`) contains four tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `log_samples` | Preprocessed log samples with extracted features, namespace, pod name, error indicators, and message entropy |
| `failure_labels` | Failure events collected from Kubernetes events, failed PipelineRuns, and unhealthy pod statuses. Failure types include: `oom`, `crash`, `image`, `scheduling`, `storage`, `config`, `health`, `network`, `timeout`, `pipeline_failure`, `permission`, `resource_limits`, `general`, `pod_failure` |
| `log_failure_correlations` | Time-proximity correlations between log samples and failure events (scored 0.5--1.0 based on temporal distance within a 30-minute window) |
| `training_runs` | Training run history recording model_id, samples used, labels used, performance metrics, and completion status |

All four tables define a `cluster_id` column for multi-cluster support. Currently, only `log_samples` and `failure_labels` actively populate it during writes; `log_failure_correlations` and `training_runs` leave it NULL. The cluster ID is derived from the active kubeconfig context name (e.g. `api-stone-prod-p02-hjvn-p1-openshiftapps-com:6443`) or falls back to `in-cluster-{KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST}` when running inside a pod.

### Clearing Stale Data

**Programmatic cleanup** via the `manage_prediction_training_data` tool (action `cleanup`):

- `cleanup_old_models(max_age_days=30, keep_min=3)` -- removes models older than 30 days, always keeping the 3 most recent
- `cleanup_old_data(max_age_days=90)` -- removes log samples, failure labels, and correlations older than 90 days

**Manual cleanup**:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.lumino/              # Clear everything (models + training data)
rm -rf ~/.lumino/models/       # Clear just models
rm -rf ~/.lumino/training_data/ # Clear just training data (SQLite DB)
```

**Disk usage note**: Models accumulate over time. The default cleanup keeps models up to 30 days old with a minimum of 3 retained. Training data is kept for 90 days. Run the `manage_prediction_training_data` tool with action `cleanup` periodically to reclaim disk space.

## KubeArchive Integration

KubeArchive stores Kubernetes resources off-cluster and provides a REST API for historical resource states and logs. LUMINO uses KubeArchive as a fallback when pods, PipelineRuns, or TaskRuns have been garbage-collected from the live cluster. The `query_kubearchive` tool queries this archive transparently.

### Endpoint Auto-Discovery

The endpoint is discovered automatically using a 5-step chain (first match wins):

1. **`KUBEARCHIVE_HOST` environment variable** (highest priority)
2. **OpenShift Route** named `kubearchive-api-server` in namespaces: `kubearchive`, `product-kubearchive`, `default`
3. **Kubernetes Ingress** named `kubearchive-api-server` in the same namespaces
4. **Kubernetes Service** named `kubearchive-api-server` (in-cluster DNS: `https://kubearchive-api-server.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>`)
5. **Kubeconfig-based Route inference** -- constructs candidate URLs from the API server domain (pattern: `https://kubearchive-api-server-{namespace}.apps.{cluster-domain}`) and probes `/livez`

Results are cached at startup. On connection failure, the cache is cleared and re-probed on the next request.

### Local Development (Port-Forwarding)

When running outside the cluster, if an in-cluster Service endpoint is discovered (step 4), LUMINO automatically sets up `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n {namespace} svc/kubearchive-api-server {local_port}:{remote_port}
```

- Tries ports 8081--8090, then falls back to a system-assigned port
- The port-forward process is auto-started and auto-cleaned up on server exit
- If `kubectl` is not available, LUMINO logs a manual fallback command for the user

### Authentication

KubeArchive authentication uses the following priority chain:

1. Provided token (from constructor / previous session)
2. In-cluster service account token (`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)
3. Existing Kubernetes client token (extracted from the API client initialized at server startup)
4. OpenShift `oc whoami -t` token (for OpenShift clusters)
5. Auto-created short-lived service account token (`kubectl create token`, 1-hour duration, Kubernetes only)

### KubeArchive Configuration

See the [Configuration](#configuration) section above for `KUBEARCHIVE_HOST` and `KUBEARCHIVE_ENABLED` environment variables.

## Prometheus/Thanos Integration

LUMINO auto-discovers Prometheus or Thanos Query endpoints for the `prometheus_query`, `resource_bottleneck_forecaster`, and `ci_cd_performance_baselining_tool` tools. Thanos Query implements the Prometheus HTTP API and is preferred when available since it provides a unified, deduplicated view across replicas.

### Endpoint Discovery Priority

| Priority | Source | Endpoint Type |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 0 | `THANOS_URL` env var | thanos |
| 1 | `PROMETHEUS_URL` env var | prometheus |
| 2 | Predefined cluster endpoints (in code) | varies |
| 3 | 5-minute TTL cache | cached |
| 4 | Auto-discovery chain (see below) | detected |
| 5 | Predefined fallback endpoints | varies |

Auto-discovery order depends on runtime environment:

- **In-cluster**: Thanos services --> Prometheus services --> Prometheus Operator CRD --> OpenShift Routes
- **Local/outside cluster**: OpenShift Routes --> Thanos services --> Prometheus Operator CRD --> Prometheus services

### Auto-Discovery Details

**OpenShift Routes**: Searches the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. Prefers the `thanos-querier` route over `prometheus-k8s`. Falls back to any route with `prometheus` in the name. Detects protocol from TLS termination config.

**Thanos Services**: Searches namespaces `openshift-monitoring`, `monitoring`, `thanos`, `observability`, `kube-prometheus`. Priority service names: `thanos-query-frontend`, `thanos-querier`, `thanos-query`. Also searches via label selectors: `app.kubernetes.io/name=thanos-query`, `app.kubernetes.io/component=query,app.kubernetes.io/name=thanos`, `app=thanos-query`, `app=thanos-querier`.

**Prometheus Services**: Searches namespaces `openshift-monitoring`, `monitoring`, `prometheus`, `kube-prometheus`, `observability`. Priority service names: `prometheus-server`, `prometheus-k8s`, `prometheus`. Also searches via label selectors: `app=prometheus`, `app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus`, `app.kubernetes.io/component=prometheus`.

**Prometheus Operator CRD**: Discovers via `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` Prometheus custom resources and their associated services (pattern: `prometheus-{name}` in the same namespace).

### Prometheus/Thanos Authentication

Authentication for Prometheus/Thanos uses the following 5 methods in priority order:

1. `oc whoami -t` -- fresh OpenShift token (most reliable for OpenShift)
2. Re-read kubeconfig file for current token
3. In-memory Kubernetes client config token
4. ServiceAccount token file (`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`)
5. Environment variables: `PROMETHEUS_TOKEN`, `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN`, `OC_TOKEN` (checked in that order)

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "env": {
    "THANOS_URL": "https://thanos-querier.example.com",
    "PROMETHEUS_TOKEN": "your-bearer-token"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The endpoint cache has a 5-minute TTL. If you change `THANOS_URL` or `PROMETHEUS_URL` at runtime, the new value takes effect on the next query.

## How It Works

LUMINO acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your Kubernetes infrastructure through the Model Context Protocol:

```

### Workflow

1. **User Query** → AI assistant receives natural language request
2. **MCP Translation** → Assistant converts query to appropriate tool calls
3. **LUMINO Processing** → Server executes Kubernetes/Prometheus operations
4. **Data Analysis** → ML/statistical algorithms process raw data
5. **AI Synthesis** → Assistant formats results into human-readable insights

### Key Features

- **Minimal Local State** - Queries cluster in real-time; optional ML model persistence in `~/.lumino/` for predictive analytics (see [ML Model Persistence](#ml-model-persistence))
- **Automatic Transport Detection** - Switches between stdio (local) and HTTP (K8s) modes
- **Token Budget Management** - Adaptive strategies to handle large log volumes
- **Intelligent Caching** - Smart caching for frequently accessed data
- **Security First** - Uses existing kubeconfig RBAC permissions, no separate auth

## MCP Client Integration

### Method 1: Using MCPM

> **Note**: MCPM installation of Pharos is pending re-publish under the new remote.
> The registry IDs (`@owner/pharos`) cannot be claimed until the remote repository
> is established.  Once the remote is set up, this section will be updated with the
> correct MCPM install command.  Until then, use **Method 2 (Manual Configuration)**
> below, or the provisioning prompt in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

---

### Method 2: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup or need to configure Claude Desktop / Cursor, follow these client-specific guides:

#### Claude Desktop

1. **Find your config file location**:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add LUMINO configuration**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumino": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/pharos",
        "python",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Verify**: Look for the hammer icon (🔨) in Claude Desktop to see available tools

---

#### Claude Code CLI

**Option A: Using MCPM** (see Method 1 above)

**Option B: Automatic Provisioning via Claude Code** (Recommended and easiest way)

Copy and paste the provisioning prompt from the [Quick Start](#for-claude-code-cli-users-easiest) section above into Claude Code. Claude will clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure the MCP server for your project.

**Option C: Manual Configuration**

1. **Clone and install**:

```bash
git clone https://TBD-NEW-REMOTE
cd pharos
uv sync  # Creates .venv with all dependencies
```

2. **Create `.mcp.json`** in your project root (for project-local config) or update `~/.claude.json` (for global config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumino": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/pharos/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pharos/main.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/pharos` with the actual absolute path where you cloned the repository (e.g., `/Users/username/projects/pharos`).

3. **Verify installation**:

```bash
# Check MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Test with a query
claude "List all namespaces in my cluster"
```

---

#### Gemini CLI

**Option A: Using MCPM** (Recommended - see Method 1 above)

**Option B: Manual Configuration**

1. **Find your config file location**:
   - macOS/Linux: `~/.config/gemini/mcp_servers.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\gemini\mcp_servers.json`

2. **Add LUMINO configuration**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumino": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/pharos",
        "python",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Verify installation**:

```bash
# Check MCP servers
gemini mcp list

# Test with a query
gemini "Show me failed pipeline runs"
```

---

#### Cursor IDE

1. **Open Cursor Settings**:
   - Press `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux)
   - Search for "MCP" or "Model Context Protocol"

2. **Add MCP Server Configuration**:

In Cursor's MCP settings, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumino": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/pharos",
        "python",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative - Using Cursor's settings.json**:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add the MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "lumino": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/pharos",
        "python",
        "main.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Cursor IDE**

4. **Verify**: Open Cursor's AI chat and check if LUMINO tools are available

---

### Configuration Notes

**Replace `/path/to/pharos`** with the actual path where you cloned the repository:

```bash
# Example paths:
# macOS/Linux: /Users/username/projects/pharos
# Windows: C:\Users\username\projects\pharos

# If installed via MCPM:
# ~/.mcp/servers/pharos/
```

**Environment Variables** (optional):

Add these to the `env` section if needed:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
    "KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE": "default",
    "PROMETHEUS_URL": "http://prometheus:9090",
    "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
  }
}
```

---

### Using Alternative Python Package Managers

#### With pip instead of uv

```json
{
  "command": "python",
  "args": [
    "/path/to/pharos/main.py"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Ensure you've activated the virtual environment first:

```bash
cd /path/to/pharos
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

#### With poetry

```json
{
  "command": "poetry",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "python",
    "main.py"
  ],
  "cwd": "/path/to/pharos"
}
```

---

### Testing Your Configuration

After configuring any client, test the connection:

1. **Check if tools are loaded**:
   - Claude Desktop: Look for 🔨 hammer icon
   - Claude Code CLI: `claude mcp list`
   - Gemini CLI: `gemini mcp list`
   - Cursor: Check AI chat for available tools

2. **Test a simple query**:

```text
"List all namespaces in my Kubernetes cluster"
```

3. **Check server logs** (if issues):

```bash
# Run server manually to see errors
cd /path/to/pharos
uv run python main.py
```

Expected output:
```text
MCP Server running in stdio mode
Available tools: 49
Waiting for requests...
```

---

### Advanced Configuration

#### Multiple Clusters

Configure multiple LUMINO instances for different clusters:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumino-prod": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/pharos", "python", "main.py"],
      "env": {
        "KUBECONFIG": "/path/to/prod-kubeconfig.yaml"
      }
    },
    "pharos-dev": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/pharos", "python", "main.py"],
      "env": {
        "KUBECONFIG": "/path/to/dev-kubeconfig.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Custom Log Level

```json
{
  "env": {
    "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG",
    "MCP_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```

---

### Supported Transports

The server automatically detects the appropriate transport:

- **stdio** - For local desktop integrations (Claude Desktop, Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor)
- **streamable-http** - For Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments

Transport is controlled by environment variables (precedence: env > k8s auto-detect > stdio):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LUMINO_TRANSPORT` | auto-detect | `stdio` or `streamable-http`; explicit override |
| `LUMINO_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Listen host; set `0.0.0.0` in containers |
| `LUMINO_BIND_PORT` | `8000` | Listen port |
| `LUMINO_STATELESS_HTTP` | `false` | Set `true` for stateless Route/Ingress deployments |
| `LUMINO_HTTP_TOKEN` | *(none)* | Bearer token — **runtime secret, never baked into images** |

**Fail-closed security contract:** non-localhost bind (`0.0.0.0` / remote IP) without a token causes main.py to refuse startup. The `/health` endpoint is always unauthenticated; all other paths require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when a token is configured.

See `config.example.yaml` for the full env-var reference including the TLS-at-Route/Ingress requirement and single-replica `stateless_http` caveat.

---

### OTLP/HTTP Ingest (phase 5) — second inbound surface

When an `otlp` source is declared and ENABLED in `config.yaml`, Lumino starts a second HTTP listener on its own port (default `4318`) for OTLP/HTTP log ingestion. This is a **separate inbound surface** from the MCP transport (spec §4.7):

| Surface | Default port | Auth | TLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP streamable-http (`LUMINO_HTTP_TOKEN`) | 8000 | Bearer (fail-closed non-localhost) | at Route/Ingress |
| OTLP ingest (`LUMINO_OTLP_TOKEN`) | 4318 | Bearer (fail-closed non-localhost) | at Route/Ingress |

OTLP ingest environment variables (set at runtime, never in config files):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LUMINO_OTLP_TOKEN` | *(none)* | Bearer token — **runtime secret, never baked into images** |
| `LUMINO_OTLP_BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Ingest listen host; set `0.0.0.0` in containers |
| `LUMINO_OTLP_BIND_PORT` | `4318` | Ingest listen port; not baked into Containerfile |

**Security warning:** localhost ingest is unauthenticated by default — set `LUMINO_OTLP_TOKEN` on any shared host. Without a token, any local process can push fabricated telemetry that the LLM will summarize. This is a local data-poisoning risk, not just local read access.

**Single-replica constraint:** the OTLP ring is in-process memory. Run a single replica or pin the collector to one replica; cross-replica ring sharing is not implemented.

See `config.example.yaml` for the full OTLP configuration reference including mandatory bounds, collector snippet, behavior table, and memory-bound disclosure.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing for Large Clusters

LUMINO is designed to handle clusters of any size efficiently:

| Cluster Size | Recommendation | Tool Strategy |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Small** (< 50 pods) | Use default settings | All tools work optimally |
| **Medium** (50-500 pods) | Use namespace filtering | Leverage adaptive tools with auto-sampling |
| **Large** (500+ pods) | Specify time windows and namespaces | Use conservative and streaming tools |
| **Very Large** (1000+ pods) | Combine filters and pagination | Progressive analysis with targeted queries |

### Token Budget Management

LUMINO automatically manages AI context limits:

- **Adaptive Sampling** - Smart tools auto-sample data when volumes are high
- **Progressive Loading** - Stream analysis processes data in chunks
- **Token Budgets** - Configurable limits prevent context overflow
- **Hybrid Strategies** - Automatically selects best analysis approach

### Query Optimization Tips

**Use Namespace Filtering**
```text
✅ "Analyze logs for pods in namespace production"
❌ "Analyze all pod logs in the cluster"
```

**Specify Time Windows**
```text
✅ "Show events from the last 2 hours"
❌ "Show all events" (might return thousands)
```

**Leverage Smart Tools**
```text
✅ "smart_summarize_pod_logs" - Adaptive analysis
❌ Direct log dumps - No processing
```

**Use Progressive Analysis**
```text
✅ Start with "overview" → drill down to "detailed"
❌ Jump directly to "deep_dive" on large datasets
```

### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Typical Response Time | Scalability |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| List namespaces | < 1s | O(1) |
| Get pod logs (1 pod) | 1-3s | O(log size) |
| Analyze pipeline run | 2-5s | O(task count) |
| Cluster-wide search | 5-15s | O(namespace count) |
| ML anomaly detection | 3-10s | O(data points) |
| Topology mapping | 5-20s | O(resource count) |

### Caching Strategy

LUMINO uses intelligent caching for frequently accessed data:

- **15-minute cache** - For web-fetched content
- **Session cache** - For hybrid log analysis
- **ML model persistence** - Predictive models and training data stored locally in `~/.lumino/` (see [ML Model Persistence](#ml-model-persistence))

### Concurrent Requests

The server handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently:

- **Thread-safe operations** - Safe parallel tool execution
- **Connection pooling** - Reuses Kubernetes API connections
- **Async HTTP** - Non-blocking Prometheus queries

### Resource Usage

**Server Resource Requirements**

| Deployment | CPU | Memory | Disk |
|------------|-----|--------|------|
| Local (stdio) | 100-500m | 256-512Mi | Minimal |
| Kubernetes | 200m-1 | 512Mi-1Gi | Minimal |
| High-load | 1-2 | 1-2Gi | Minimal |

**Note**: LUMINO requires minimal resources. ML models and training data are persisted locally in `~/.lumino/` (see [ML Model Persistence](#ml-model-persistence)). Most processing happens in the AI assistant.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Kubernetes cluster found**
```text
Error: Unable to load kubeconfig
```
Ensure you have a valid kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config` or are running inside a cluster.

**Permission denied for resources**
```text
Error: Forbidden - User cannot list resource
```
Check your RBAC permissions. The server needs read access to the resources you want to query.

**Tool timeout**
For large clusters, some tools may timeout. Use filtering options (namespace, labels) to reduce scope.
