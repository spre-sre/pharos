"""
Tests for Kubernetes client initialization in server-mcp.py.

These tests verify the structural and behavioural properties of the K8s
client initialization code, guarding against:

- Duplicate config loading (config.load_incluster_config / load_kube_config
  called more than once).
- Split-brain: KubeArchiveEndpointDiscovery holding references to client
  objects from one init pass while the rest of the application uses objects
  from a different init pass.
- Missing k8s_autoscaling_api in the consolidated init block.
- Inconsistent None-setting when client construction fails.
- Accidental removal or repositioning of cache variables.

The tests are source-analysis based (reading the .py file as text) so they
run without importing the full module and its heavy side-effects.
